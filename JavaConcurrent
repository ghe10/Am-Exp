HashTable is slow because the whole object has only one lock, this will prevent any access from

ConcurrentHashMap is generated with 1. Segment 2. HashEntry

Threadpool's execute will return an future staff, we can use it to check whether the task is finished.

ReentrantLock in java can be fair or unfailr (fair: first queue, first serve, unfair: no sqauence)
fair is implemented by a waiting queue staff
