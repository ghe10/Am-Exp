Section 11. Use tracer bullets
It is possible to use the concept of tracer bullets in machine gun to programming and building a new system.
The advantage over full design and construct models separately is we will have a working sys and make progress and problem visible for whole system.

1. Use tracer code, i.e. build a simple skeleton of the whole system with minimum functionality.
2. Add component to it. This makes it easier to provide sth working, have a structure that helps everyone to make more progress, easier to
   debug and test comparing to implemention without a whole skeleton and functionality.
3. The tracer code may not be working, make change for the small part of code to fix it. This can be discovered earlier.

Note about prototyping: it will generate some one-use code before refactor and re-implementation in the final environment. It can servers as
the reconnaissance of tracer code.

Section 1. The cat ate my source code.
Take responsibility, make back up and other preparation. Instead of providing excuses, try to provide options. Before that, try what people may
think about to solve the problem. This will make the staff easier I guess.

When sth goes wrong, just be honest and admit it. Try to fix it.

Section 2. Software Entropy
The code in a project tends to get messy as time goes by. This is the tradition of the universe. Try to stop it.

1. Broken window: if some of the code is broken/in bad status, it is easy to lead a trend and make the whole project goes stupid. Fix small
   problems when discovered.
2. Fireman: a good, clean project will help the programmer to keep this good trend and make the next steps clean as it is now.
