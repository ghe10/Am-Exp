Disk
Problem to consider: partial write during power off, only one sector write is automic


Disk is organized into sectors
- physical disk: 512 Byte
- SSD: 4KB

File system map sectors to blocks
- usually one block is 16KB (this is also the default innodb page size)

InnoDB
- default page size is 16KB
- InnoDB allocate disk space with unit of extent for performance
  - extent is 1MB, contains 64 pages
- above extent is segment
- above segment is tablespace

general structure in innoDB:

-tablespace
 -segments
  -extents
    -pages
     -rows
