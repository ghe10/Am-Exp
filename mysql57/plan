1. Understand basic huge page allocation and heap memory allocation for mysqld
2. Go into the server to find the usage of storage engine


3. Road to storage engine: from /sql/sql_insert.cc etc file, each of these files will work on a specifc part of sql query and calls lower lever
   torage engine api to achieve it.
   guessed route: sql_prepare, sql_parse, execute
   We will follow sql_insert.cc's path to go through the path and understand what is going on from a query to engine. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/guided-tour-skeleton.html

4. Step 3 is partially done, but it is hard to udnerstand what is going on pure by code, we need to understand design first.
   Now read through https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-storage-engine.html to understand how storage engine of innodb works
   and https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/mysql-server/8.0.13/
