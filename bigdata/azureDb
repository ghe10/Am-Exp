DTU:
A database transaction unit (DTU) represents a blended measure of CPU, memory, reads, and writes. The DTU-based purchasing model offers a set of preconfigured bundles of compute resources and included storage to drive different levels of application performance. If you prefer the simplicity of a preconfigured bundle and fixed payments each month, the DTU-based model might be more suitable for your needs.

It is like a pre-defined unit which combines multiple kind of resurces that makes it easier for customer to define resource usage.

I think is is focusing on computation but not storage size

service tier list:
Latency of changing service tier or rescaling compute size

When you create an Azure SQL Database, you specify both a Service Tier and a performance level. Tiers are
Standard and Premium. (It was mentioned earlier that there is also a Basic Tier, used for less demanding workloads.) 

(search for 2.8 Service Tiers in page 13)

elastic pool:
 All the databases in the elastic pool are hosted on the same physical SQL Server
instance in the data center, so they share the same memory, the same I/O, the same tempdb and the same CPUs.
Behind the scenes, SQL Server Resource Governor is managing many of the shared resources.

It is still on same server, but the server resource can be shared by multiple databases which helps when some databases are at higj load and the 
others with low load.
