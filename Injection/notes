1) Could not find a suitable constructor in NoInterfaceClass. Classes must have either one (and only one) constructor annotated with @Inject or a zero-argument constructor that is not private.
  at NoInterfaceClass.class(NoInterfaceClass.java:14)
  while locating NoInterfaceClass
  
  As long as we have something wiht constructor @Inject, it will be used by Guice modeluct

2) we can have a @Inject private constructor, then no one can do random staff

3) without @Inject, we must have a constructor without param.
