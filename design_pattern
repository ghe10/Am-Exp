1. Simple factory pattern

Factory is used to encapsulate the creation of an object. It is usually used when there are multiple possible classes that might be created.
The factory method encapsulate the logic of choosing the correct class and generate the related object.

It is also possible to use a function from base class and override it all the way. Then the "factory" func just need to call
that function and the correct overrided function will be called for the sub classes. The "factory" function will return correct object or operation.
