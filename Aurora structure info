	|--->| 16 kB pages.
We allows rds cp to access any page and get any number of pages in sequence. => read Dage, write log.

Volumes are separate into protection groups (pg).
Default volume is 160 GB, each PG will has 10 GB data (fixed). (Now we might support less than 160 GB for smaller db)

RDS db instance <==> VOLUME, it is a one to one mapping. 
When we need more data space, we will add new pg to it.
