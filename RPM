 Red Hat Package Manager
 
 An RPM package can contain an arbitrary set of files. The larger part of RPM files encountered are “binary RPMs” (or BRPMs) 
 containing the compiled version of some software. There are also “source RPMs” (or SRPMs) files containing the source code used 
 to produce a package. These have an appropriate tag in the file header that distinguishes them from normal (B)RPMs,
 causing them to be extracted to /usr/src on installation. SRPMs customarily carry the file extension “.src.rpm”
