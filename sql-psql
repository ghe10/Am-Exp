psql with json:
select row_to_json(words) from words;

select row_to_json(t) from (select user, operation from latest_operation) t

select row_to_json(t)
from (
  select id, text from words
) t
 {"id":6013,"text":"advancement"}
 PostgreSQL 9.2 is JSON support

 The CROSS JOIN
A CROSS JOIN matches every row of the first table with every row of the second table. If the input tables have x and y columns, respectively, the resulting table will have x+y columns. Because CROSS JOINs have the potential to generate extremely large tables, care must be taken to use them only when appropriate.

The INNER JOIN
A INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (table1 and table2) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of table1 with each row of table2 to find all pairs of rows, which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of table1 and table2 are combined into a result row.

left outer join ： add null to left side with no match
right outer join : add null to right side tb with no match in left tb
full outer join : add null to add staff with no match

eg:
SELECT *
    FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);

CREATE VIEW view_dept_201
 AS SELECT emp_id, name, hire_date
 FROM gdb.employees 
 WHERE department = 201;


for get some info to a json and combine the json to sth:
1. get the json data

select operation, user, environment from environment_type right outer join latest_user on 
  (environment_type.cluster = latest_user.cluster and environment_type.environment = latest_user.environment)

2. make it into json

select row_to_json(user_data)
from (
  select operation, user, environment from environment_type right outer join latest_user on 
  (environment_type.cluster = latest_user.cluster and environment_type.environment = latest_user.environment) 
) user_data

3. add as a new column in the view

# select environment_type.XXX, ...., last_user_json from
# (
#   select row_to_json(user_data)
#   from (
#    select operation, user, environment from environment_type right outer join latest_user on 
#     (environment_type.cluster = latest_user.cluster and environment_type.environment = latest_user.environment) 
#      where 
#   ) user_data
# ) last_user_json

with as version:

with last_user_json_data as  (
select environment_type.cluster，environment_type.environment， row_to_json(user_data)
from (
  select operation, user, environment from environment_type right outer join latest_user on 
  (environment_type.cluster = latest_user.cluster and environment_type.environment = latest_user.environment) 
) user_data
）

select environment_type.xxx user_data from last_user_json_data as last_user where environment_type.xxx = user_data.xxx

This might work


------------------
Aggregation functions are very useful in this case:

CREATE TABLE tbl_Students
(
    StudID INT 
    ,StudName CHARACTER VARYING
    ,StudGrades CHAR(1)
    ,test CHAR(1)
);

INSERT INTO tbl_Students 
VALUES 
(1,'Anvesh','A','T'),(2,'Kimly','B','T')
,(3,'Jenny','C','T'),(4,'Ali','B', 'T')
,(5,'Mukesh','D','T'),(6,'Sofia','A', 'F');

SELECT 	
	StudGrades
	,json_agg(json_build_object('StudName', StudName, 'test', test)) AS StudPerGrade
FROM tbl_Students
GROUP BY StudGrades

view: a relation defined by a query over other relations, not physically in the db

view can be materialized, constructed periodically and speed up the query on view
